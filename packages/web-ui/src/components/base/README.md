# Atomic Web Design Component Library

This monorepo contains a collection of reusable UI components, organized into atoms, molecules and organisms. These components serve as the building blocks for creating consistent and maintainable user interfaces across our projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/
├── atoms/
│   ├── Button/
│   ├── Input/
│   ├── Typography/
│   └── ...
├── molecules/
│   ├── Card/
│   ├── Form/
│   ├── Navbar/
│   └── ...
├── docs/
├── scripts/
└── package.json
```

- `atoms/`: Contains basic, indivisible UI components
- `molecules/`: Contains more complex components composed of atoms
- `organisms/`: Contains groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
- `docs/`: Documentation for components and usage guidelines
- `scripts/`: Build and development scripts
